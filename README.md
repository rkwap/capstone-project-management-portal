# Capstone Project Management Portal

The capstone project helps students to apply the engineering fundamentals, prepares for future challenges and provides an opportunity to work in teams and find solutions to real-world, open-ended technology-related problems. With a variety of stakeholders (students, mentors, coordinators) managing such a large project is a difficult task. In this paper, we present an open-source Capstone Project Management Portal, which provides the facility to manage all the processes involved in a year-long project. Until now many universities manage these processes manually or in a semi-automated manner. Research into the workflow of this whole system revealed major data inconsistency and redundancy issues which lead to the development of this portal.
